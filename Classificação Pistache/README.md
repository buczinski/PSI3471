## Pistachio Classification Project

This project aims to classify different types of pistachios using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The approach involves:

Image pre-processing using the OpenCV library;
Training based on limited datasets, exploring strategies to handle data scarcity;
Application of classical machine learning algorithms (such as SVM, KNN, etc.);
Use of transfer learning with fine-tuning of robust pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
The project seeks to compare the performance of classical models and deep neural networks under different input and pre-processing conditions.
