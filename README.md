# PSI3471 – Fundamentals of Intelligent Electronic Systems

This repository contains projects developed as part of the course **PSI3471 – Fundamentals of Intelligent Electronic Systems** (Fundamentos de Sistemas Eletrônicos Inteligentes), an introduction to **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**.

All algorithms, implementations, and analyses were created during the course, either as exercises, project deliverables, or personal extensions of class topics.

## Topics Covered

- Basic Image Processing
- Feature Extraction (e.g., edges, corners)
- Classical Machine Learning Algorithms (SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Naive Baynes)
- Basic Neural Networks and Deep Learning Foundations
- Object Detection and Recognition
- Evaluation Metrics and Model Performance Analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python. C++
- NumPy, OpenCV2, scikit-learn, TensorFlow Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks (for prototyping and visualization)

## Notes

All code and solutions were developed for educational purposes as part of coursework. The repository serves both as a record of the learning process and as reference material for future projects.
